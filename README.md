Project: AI-Enabled Query Management System
1.	answer queries from both customers and employees;
2.	analyse stored queries to derive useful insights;

We propose a web-based application that is able to extract text-based information from a database to answer users’ queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and techniques. More specifically, the queries from users are converted into word vectors, which are then compared to existing data in the database. A set of results are then shown to the user in the order of semantic similarity, rather than keyword matches. Users’ queries are also captured and stored in the database for further visualization and analysis.
